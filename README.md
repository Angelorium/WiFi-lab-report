## Abstract
This report explores the performance of Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections within a Local Area Network (LAN) environment using tools like iperf3 and Wireshark. By conducting a series of experiments, the report compares the goodput (speed at which useful data arrives at destination) over different protocols (TCP and UDP) in different network scenarios: direct Ethernet connections, Wi-Fi connections, and a hybrid setup combining both.
