\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
 The motivation behind this report is to assess and compare the performance of Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections within a LAN. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of these technologies is very important for optimizing network setups in practical scenarios. The goals of this lab include evaluating the goodput of TCP and UDP transmissions over Ethernet and Wi-Fi, analyzing the impact of protocol overhead and wireless constraints. This investigation aims to provide network performance considerations that can be useful to guide decisions related to a LAN network design.
